This app is a companion app and is intended to simplify the workflow of synchronising garmin 1000 flight log from the cockpit to different devices. 


# Intended Usage and Workflow

- Using a USB simcard dongle, plugin the sim card containing the logs to your iPad or device and from the list of flight logs on the app press the plus button, navigate to the simcard from the file selection page. The app should discover automatically the log files on the sim card and import them into the app and your iCloud drive. It may take a bit of file to process the files if your simcard contains many logs. After the first use only new log files will be discovered and imported, you do not need to individually select the missing file, the app will find what it is missing.
- You can also directly upload files from your mac by importing them with the plus icon on this app

Once the files have been imported, you can

- using this app on your computer, you should have access to the logs uploaded from your iPad.
- review the information on a specific file, which can give you quick access to timings or fuel used while still in the cockpit
- review some statistics over time, the app will group flight and summarize trips away from base.
- the files will be synchronised on your iCloud Drive, so you can access them from other devices seeemlessly, for example after importing from your ipad, you can review the files et export them from your macos computer if you installed the macos version of the app. If you start the app on another device with the iCloud Drive synchronised the flights will be also available to browse from the app.
- upload a file to FlySto.net. Note this app is independent of FlySto, but only provide connectivity to their upload API to simplify workflow.

You can check the support website for example of uses.
