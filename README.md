# Flight Log Stats

This app is currently in development and a work in progress.

## Goal

This app is about simplifying the workflow around management of Garmin Perspective Flight logs.

The usage is:

### Log Synchronisation

- from an ipad with a simcard dongle, press the + icon and select the simcard from the file browser. All the logs should then bee imported, and will be made available and sync'd on your icloud drive.
- The files will then be available (once your ipad had network available) on your mac and iphone. You can access the logs via the Files app or via the app on a different device.

### Basics review of the logs

From the app, you can:

- see summary of the logs you imported
- see some information about each log, and a fuel analysis page where you can enter a fuel target and it will estimate how much fuel you may need to add in each tank to match the target. This is especially useful in europe for a plane where the information is in gallons, but you need to decide the quantity in liters
- see some summary about the trips you made. In the statistics page, the app will try to group the flights away from your home base and give basics stats, for example how many miles, the total times, fuel used etc for the trip away from home.

## CAVEATS

This has so far only been tested with the logs from one aircraft, an SR22 with Garmin Perspective+
This should never be used as a primary planning tool, but just as a supplementary tool. Always check independently all the calculation made by the apps
